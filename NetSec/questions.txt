### 5.1.1 Exploring Network Traffic (7 points)

  1. Should I be using the "Switch" in wireshark?
  2. Should the cp1.1.*.txt files end with a new line?
      - I only ask, because of the netid.txt requiring a newline for the script setup to work.



### 5.1.2 Interacting with Network Hosts 

  1. Should the cp2.2.*.txt files end with a new line?
  2. By "Make sure you submit the entire unmodified HTTP response, not just the HTML portion." do you mean use the "-i" (include) arg in curl to include the HTTP headers?



### 5.2.1.1 ARP Spoofing (25 points)

1. Your program MUST forward all packets. The intercepted hosts should not observe any disrup-
tion in communications.
2. The order of the outputs does not matter, and each of the 4 answers MAY be printed more than once.
