As I was working on the MP, I noticed I would get many false positives where filtering them out is nearly impossible. I wouldn't use IDS for, say, enterprise systems level since the general methodology of the attack must be known before hand. Yeah, while some generic sequences of syscalls are suspicious (say opening a command shell and dropper like commands), ground-zero attacks could go unnoticed. I feel with enterprise level software, the types of attaks that make it through are "ground-zero" never before seen exploits. Lastly, the training data quality matters where inssuficient data can result in poor detection results.
